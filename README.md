# About me
Hi! I am Giavanna, go by she/her/hers, and am from Kansas City, MO. I am currently a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a M.S. in Public Policy and Management and will graduate in May 2023. I also have a bachelor's from Washington University in St. Louis, where I double majored in Economics and Urban Studies. 

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

I am interested in a career in data analytics and to help programs and businesses derive insights from their data and improve their objectives. I wanted to take the Telling Stories with Data course so that I can become a better communicator with data. In addition to: 

- Create more attractive data visualizations
- Create more compelling and persuasive data visualizations
- Obtain more practice and skill with data visualization tools, such as Tableau
