# About me
Hi! I am Giavanna and go by she/her/hers. I am currently a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a M.S. in Public Policy and Management and will graduate in May 2023. I also have a bachelor's from Washington University in St. Louis, where I double majored in Economics and Urban Studies. 

# What I hope to learn
I am interested in a career in data analytics, so I wanted to take the Telling Stories with Data course so that I can become a better communicator with data. I am also hoping to learn to create more attractive and more compelling data visualizations in addition to obtaining more practice with data visualization tools, such as Tableau.
