### Sleep is an Intergral Part of Life

We spend 1/3 of our life sleeping

- Sleeping helps recharge mind and body (source:sleep foundation)
- Scientists are still trying to better understand the purpose of sleep (NIH), but it helps remove toxins from the brain, facilitates learning and memory formation.  It also helps with concentration and responsiveness. Sleep affects almost function and part of your body, including brain, mental health, heart, immunity, and metabolism (NIH)

- Not getting enough sleep, however could lower ability to learn by 40% (Sleep Foundation). 
- Sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and depression (NIH).

- Only **35%** of adults believe adequate sleep makes you more effective.
- Only **54%** of parents think sleep impacts performance

### Definition of Sleep Deprivation 

- Short sleep duration or sleep deprivation means getting less than the recommended hours of sleep (CDC)
- Recommended at least 7 hours for adults, 8-10 for teens, and 9-12 for school age children (CDC)
- “Insomnia is characterized by an inability to initiate or maintain sleep.” (CDC)

-  If other solutions do not work, try talking to a medical provider.

# User research 

## Target audience

I hope to reach those who tend to struggle the most with sleep duration, which are high school students, ethnic minorities, and those with lower socioeconomic status. My approach was to reach out to people that I know with characteristics of the audience who would be willing to do the user research.

## Interview script

I want to get feedback for the outline of content for a project I am doing that will be included on a webpage.  It should take 10-15 minutes to complete.

1. Can you tell me what this is about? Goal: To see if they understand the content and what it is about.
2. Is there anything confusing or that you would like clarification on? Goal: To see if there was anything unclear in particular that I might need to change.
3. Is there anything notable or insightful that you gained from this? Goal: To see what parts worked best.
4. Who do you think this is for?  Goal: To get clarification on who the message seems to be aimed toward.
5. How engaging is this?   Goal: To understand if the story seemed interesting or compelling.
6. Any other questions or comments about this project? Goal: To gain any other insights from the interview.

## Interview findings

I shared the wireframe/storyboard as a draft of my project on Shorthand. I was only able to interview 2 people. One is a Black female in her 50s, and the other is a Black male in his 50s.

1. Can you tell me what this is about? 

Interview 1: She said it was about sleep deprivation and how certain groups have more problems with sleep.

Interview 2: He said it was about how much sleep certain amount of people are getting.

2. Is there anything confusing or that you would like clarification on?

Interview 1: She thought it was clear and broken down well.

Interview 2: Thought one of the statistics on the belief on sleep effectiveness didn't appear right.

3. Is there anything notable or insightful that you gained from this?

Interview 1: She delved into expectations and reasons for variatons in demographics and health outcomes. For example, expected adults prevalence on sleep deprivation to be higher than high schoolers.

Interview 2: Thought it was interesting how sleep deprivation varied across groups.
 
4. Who do you think this is for? 

Interview 1: She thought possibly for a college class to inform people who might work with groups who struggle with sleep deprivation or health issues associated with it.

Interview 2: Thought it was for all groups of people and ages.

5. How engaging is this? 

Interview 1: Thought it was interesting and informative and has facts people might not know.

Interview 2: Thought it was intesting.

6. Any other questions or comments about this project? 
 
Interview 1: The main takeaway she got from it is that sleep is important, and it is important to take care of your body.

Interview 2: Did not have any other comments.


# Identified changes for Part III
 
For one of the interviews, the main focus seems to have been on the demographics and the associated health outcomes. For the other, they were more focused on the demographics and earlier sections of the story. The geographical variation wasn't mentioned in both interviews. It could be since it was closer to the end. My story could be too long or have too many data visualizations. Someone in class mentioned that I had a lot of data visualizations, so it might be best to reduce them.

The expected audience given from the interviews were different from each other and different from what I intended. I might change the story to make the intended audience clearer or maybe have a more narrow audience. 

From feeback from the in-class exercise, I changed the graphs focused on education and income from circle views graphs to bar graphs, since it appeared confusing. I also changed the color to associate it more with the map comparisons of income and sleep deprivation. I did this change before sharing the story for the interviews. Other feedback included possibly focusing more on the health implications and why sleep is important so that it could resonate more with the audience, so that is something I am considering. I might include the data visualizations on the associated health outcomes closer to the beginnning of the story after briefly discussing the impacts of inadequate sleep. Even thought I thought it would be interesting, I might use scatter plots instead of the maps to show correlation if I decide not to include geography as part of the audience or discussion.
