# Final Project: Part One

## Outline

For my project, I plan on discussing the topic around sleep and sleep deprivation. This is a topic that is relevant to everyone, and I think will resonate with a lot of people. I want to focus on the extent it is an issue  by  discussing the prevalence of sleep deprivation in the U.S. and how it varies by demographics and geography, such as by age, gender, race, state, and urban/rural, making sure to highlight populations that tend to struggle with sleep deprivation the most. I also want to look at the prevalence of behaviors and risk factors associated with poor sleep, such as mental health conditions and physical activity levels. I plan on using correlations between risk factors/behaviors and poor sleep for data.

There were also a couple of statistics on people’s views on sleep, such as beliefs on whether getting enough sleep makes you effective, which could be a useful addition. The main focus will be on the prevalence of sleep deprivation and how it varies across groups. I also plan on mentioning briefly the health implications of inadequate sleep to highlight the importance of the topic. I also want to state what sleep deprivation and insomnia actually means in the beginning of the presentation. As a call to action, I could provide information on sleep hygiene and direct them to relevant resources. 

For the storyline:
1. I first plan on giving a brief description on the function/purpose of sleep and what it helps us achieve.
2. Next, I give an overall statistic on sleep deprivation in the U.S. 
3. Next, I will explain what sleep deprivation and insomnia is defined as.
4. Go into more detail on sleep deprivation prevalence across groups.
5. Prevalence of behaviors/risk factors for sleep and correlations between risk factors and sleep deprivation.
6. Briefly highlight health implications of insufficient sleep.
7. Call to action by giving common sleep hygiene tips and link to resources.

## The Data

- One of the data sources I plan on using is from the CDC’s trends on short sleep duration. I plan on including its data on gender, age group, and race, which would help understand its prevalence and how it varies by group. Links: https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data-and-statistics/adults.html; https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data-and-statistics/high-school-students.html; https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data-and-statistics/children.html 
- This next dataset includes data on short sleep duration by state and county level. It also has data on the prevalence of factors associated with less sleep. I plan on including the data that gives percentages of those not engaging in physical activity by state. It also has the prevalence of heart disease, which is also an association. This could also be useful in creating a map to see if there's an association between sleep and each of the other factors.

- The CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics also has data on how sleep varies by socioeconomic status and how it varies if one lives in an urban area or not, which I plan on including to understand the prevalence based on group. Link: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db436.htm
- The National Sleep Foundation’s article gives some statistics on people’s thoughts about sleep, which I could briefly point out in the presentation. Link: https://www.thensf.org/sleep-facts-and-statistics/ 
- This dataset gives data on mental health status. I plan on using the data that relates to having at least 14 mentally unhealthy days. Link: https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Chronic-Disease-Indicators/U-S-Chronic-Disease-Indicators-Mental-Health/ixrt-gnsg 

## Method and Medium

I plan using Tableau to create the data visualizations for this project. For the presentation, I plan on using Shorthand.
