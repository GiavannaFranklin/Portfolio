The data for the data visualizations on this page comes from the OECD website. It gives data on the  general government debt-to-GDP ratio, which is a measure of debt as a percentage of GDP.  On the OECD website, this ratio is included as an indicator for government finance sustainability. The first method of data visualization of the government debt is a bar chart, the second one is a grid of line charts, and the third one is an area chart. For the first graph, a bar chart is used to compare countries' debt in addition to the OECD average and OECD total debt for just one year. For this one, it is easier to compare countries from each other. The second data visualization,  the grid of line charts, also includes data for each country and overall OECD debt but has multiple years included, so each country/overall OECD has its own line chart for debt over the years. 

The third data visualization, the area chart, gives data on the average debt-to-GDP ratio for all OECD countries. I wanted to include the average of the countries for an audience who wanted to just focus on the trend for the countries in the aggregate.  It includes data over multiple years as the grid of line charts but from 2007 to 2021 instead of from 1995 to 2021 since that was the only years data was available. The area chart is also similar to the first in that it only includes one graph.  I chose to represent the data as an area chart since it helps to easily visualize the extent of the debt overtime.  I chose red for the variable to help signify the negative connotation of increasing debt-to-GDP ratio.
